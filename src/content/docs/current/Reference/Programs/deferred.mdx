-------------------------------------------------

A composite-style pass which runs after (most) opaque [gbuffers](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) programs but before (most) translucent [gbuffers](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) programs. Like other composite-style programs, it renders a single fullscreen quad over the resolution of the buffer(s) it writes to.
