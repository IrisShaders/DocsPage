-------------------------------------------------


An Iris-exclusive composite-style pass that runs before the [shadow pass](/current/reference/programs/shadow). It's intended to be used for setting up any data that is needed for the [shadow pass](/current/reference/programs/shadow). Like other composite-style programs, it renders a single fullscreen quad over the resolution of the buffer(s) it writes to.
