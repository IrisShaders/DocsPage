-------------------------------------------------

A composite pass which runs directly after the [shadow pass](/current/reference/programs/shadow) and writes to [shadowcolor](/current/reference/buffers/shadowcolor) buffers. It can be used to process data from the [shadow pass](/current/reference/programs/shadow). Like other composite programs, it renders a single fullscreen quad over the resolution of the buffer(s) it writes to.
