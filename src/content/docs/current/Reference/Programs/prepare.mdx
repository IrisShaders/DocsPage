-------------------------------------------------

A composite pass which runs after the [shadow pass](/current/reference/programs/shadow) but before the [gbuffers](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) programs. It can be used to set up any data needed for the [gbuffers](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) programs. Like other composite programs, it renders a single fullscreen quad over the resolution of the buffer(s) it writes to.
