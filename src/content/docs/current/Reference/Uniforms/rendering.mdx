These uniforms store information related to rendering, such as near/far planes, chunk offsets, fog parameters, and more.


## near
```glsl
uniform float near;
```
The near clipping plane distance. Unless changed by a mod, this is equal to `0.05`.

----------------


## far
```glsl
uniform float far;
```
The current render distance, in blocks. Despite the name, this is not the far clipping plane distance, which is roughly `far * 4.0`.


----------------


## alphaTestRef
```glsl
uniform float alphaTestRef;
```
This value stores the alpha value that Iris recommends you discard pixels below. This value is commonly `0.1`, but can change in certain cases. Therefore, it is recommended to use the uniform over a hardcoded value. The value is also affected by the [`alphaTest`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/rendering#alphatest) directive. It is normally used like this:
```glsl
if (albedoOut.a < alphaTestRef) discard;
```

:::note
This uniform is designed to work with the modern syntax for fragment shader outputs (`out`). When using the legacy syntax (`gl_FragData`) this uniform is not necessary as the alpha test is performed automatically. However, this can be disabled using the [`alphaTest`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/rendering#alphatest) directive.

----------------


## chunkOffset
```glsl
uniform vec3 chunkOffset;
```
The chunk offset in model space for the currently rendering chunk of terrain. Used in combination with [`vaPosition`](/current/reference/attributes/vaposition) to get the model space position as follows:

```glsl
vec3 model_pos = vaPosition + chunkOffset;
```

The value of `chunkOffset` is all 0s when not rendering terrain, or when using the `compatibility` profile.

----------------


## entityColor
```glsl
uniform vec4 entityColor;
```
The entity tint color. The `rgb` components store the color, and the `a` component stores the blend factor. The entity color should be applied as follows:

```glsl
color.rgb = mix(color.rgb, entityColor.rgb, entityColor.a);
```

----------------


## blendFunc
```glsl
uniform ivec4 blendFunc;
```
The alpha blending function multipliers for the current program, as described in [`blend.<program>`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/rendering#blend). The components of the vector store the following:

- `x`: source RGB
- `y`: destination RGB
- `z`: source Alpha
- `w`: destination Alpha

The value stored in each component is one of the following hardcoded integer values (see [LWJGL docs](https://javadoc.lwjgl.org/constant-values.html#org.lwjgl.opengl.GL11.GL_SRC_COLOR)):

| Blend Value             | Integer Value |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| `GL_ZERO`               | 0             |
| `GL_ONE`                | 1             |
| `GL_SRC_COLOR`          | 768           |
| `GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR`| 769           |
| `GL_SRC_ALPHA`          | 770           |
| `GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA`| 771           |
| `GL_DST_ALPHA`          | 772           |
| `GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA`| 773           |
| `GL_DST_COLOR`          | 774           |
| `GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR`| 775           |
| `GL_SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE` | 776           |

----------------


## atlasSize
```glsl
uniform ivec2 atlasSize;
```
This value stores the size of the texture atlas. It only stores a value when the texture atlas is bound, and will return `0` when not.

----------------


## renderStage
```glsl
uniform int renderStage;
```
This uniform stores the "render stage" of the current geometry. This can be used to identify what type of geometry is being rendered in more detail than the [gbuffer program](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) it's running in. The uniform value is intended to be compared to one of the [render stage preprocessor macros](/current/reference/macros/render_stages) which are defined by Iris.

----------------


## fogColor
```glsl
uniform vec3 fogColor;
```
The horizon fog color used by the vanilla game for sky rendering and fog. It can be dependent on biome, time of day, and viewing angle.

----------------


## skyColor
```glsl
uniform vec3 skyColor;
```
The upper sky color used by the vanilla game for sky rendering. It can be dependent on biome, time of day, but not viewing angle.

----------------


## fogDensity
```glsl
uniform float fogDensity;
```
This uniform stores the relative fog density used for vanilla fog, based on the current biome, weather, water/lava/packed snow, etc. The value ranges from `0.0` (lowest density) to `1.0` (highest density).


----------------


## fogStart
```glsl
uniform float fogStart;
```
This uniform stores the starting distance in blocks used for vanilla fog, based on the current biome, weather, water/lava/packed snow, etc.


----------------


## fogEnd
```glsl
uniform float fogEnd;
```
This uniform stores the ending distance in blocks used for vanilla fog, based on the current biome, weather, water/lava/packed snow, etc.


----------------


## fogMode
```glsl
uniform int fogMode;
```
This uniform stores the fog type used for vanilla fog, based on the current biome, weather, water/lava/packed snow, etc. This is the function used to determine the strength of fog based on distance.

The value stored in each component is one of the following hardcoded integer values (see [LWJGL docs](https://javadoc.lwjgl.org/constant-values.html#org.lwjgl.opengl.GL11.GL_EXP)):

- `GL_EXP`: 2048
- `GL_EXP2` : 2049
- `GL_LINEAR`: 9729

----------------


## fogShape
```glsl
uniform int fogShape;
```
This uniform encodes the fog shape used for vanilla fog, based on the current biome, weather, water/lava/packed snow, caves, etc. The following values are possible:

- `0`: sphere
- `1`: cylinder
