import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

These uniforms store information about the status of the player in the world, including gamemode, potion/status effects, current health/hunger/etc, user options related to the player, and more.


## isEyeInWater
```glsl
uniform int isEyeInWater;
```
This uniform outputs the current substance that the camera is in. Possible values are:

| Value | State         |
| ----- | ------------- |
| `0`   | none/other    |
| `1`   | water         |
| `2`   | lava          |
| `3`   | powdered snow |

----------------


## isSpectator <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform bool isSpectator;
```
This value is `true` when the player is in spectator mode and `false` otherwise.

----------------


## isRightHanded <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform bool isRightHanded;
```
This boolean uniform is `true` when the player is using the right hand (default) as the main hand and `false` when the left hand is set as the main hand through the Minecraft settings.

----------------


## blindness
```glsl
uniform float blindness;
```
This value stores the blindness effect as a multiplier. It ranges from `0` to `1` where `0` is no blindness and `1` is full blindness. The uniform is only between `0` and `1` during transitions between having or not having blindness. More information on the blindness effect can be found at the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Blindness).

----------------


## darknessFactor
```glsl
uniform float darknessFactor;
```
This uniform stores the strength of the darkness effect. The value is `0.0` when the effect is not present, `1.0` when the effect is active, and is interpolated between those values during transitions.

----------------


## darknessLightFactor
```glsl
uniform float darknessLightFactor;
```
The darkness status effect creates a pulsating dimming effect in the game lighting. This uniform stores the current strength of the dimming effect. The value is `0.0` is the minimum dimming, `1.0` when the effect is the maximum dimming, and is interpolated between those values during transitions.

----------------


## nightVision
```glsl
uniform float nightVision;
```
This value stores the night vision effect as a multiplier. It ranges from `0` to `1` where `0` is no night vision and `1` is full night vision. The uniform is only between `0` and `1` during transitions between having or not having night vision. More information on the blindness effect can be found at the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Night_Vision).

----------------


## playerMood
```glsl
uniform float playerMood;
```
This uniform stores the player's mood value. This value increments when the player is in a cave (or any structure with low block and sky light). The value ranges between `0.0` and `1.0` and resets to `0.0` after it increments to `1.0`. More information on mood can be found at the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ambience#Cave_ambience).

----------------


## constantMood <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float constantMood;
```

Equivalent to [`playerMood`](/current/reference/uniforms/status#playermood) except when it does not reset after hitting `1.0`, remaining at that value until the player leaves a cave or otherwise causes the mood value to decrease.

----------------


## currentPlayerAir <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```
uniform float currentPlayerAir;
```
This value stores the relative player air when underwater ranging from `0` to `1`. That means when the player is at full air, this value is `1`, and when they are out of air (e.g. drowning) the value is `0`. The value is `-1` in creative and spectator modes. To absolute air of the player, multiply this value by the uniform [`maxPlayerAir`](/current/reference/uniforms/status#maxplayerair).

----------------


## maxPlayerAir <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float maxPlayerAir;
```
This value stores the maximum player air when underwater. This is the internal value used by Minecraft, not the number of bubbles in the user interface. This value is `-1` in creative and spectator modes. In a default survival world this value is `300`.

----------------


## currentPlayerArmor <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float currentPlayerArmor;
```
This value stores the relative player armor value ranging from `0` to `1`. That means when the player wearing armor that completely fills the armor bar this value is `1`, and when they are not wearing any armor the value is `0`. The value is `-1` in creative and spectator modes. To absolute armor value of the player, multiply this value by the uniform [`maxPlayerArmor`](/current/reference/uniforms/status#maxplayerarmor).

----------------


## maxPlayerArmor <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float maxPlayerArmor;
```
This value stores the maximum player armor value. This is the internal value used by Minecraft, not the number of armor icons in the user interface. In a default world this value is `50` unless changed by mods. Modes without hunger (such as creative and spectator modes) will still indicate the same maximum armor value.

----------------


## currentPlayerHealth <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float currentPlayerHealth;
```
This value stores the relative player health ranging from `0` to `1`. That means when the player is at full health, this value is `1`, and when they die this values reaches `0`. The value is `-1` in creative and spectator modes. To absolute health of the player, multiply this value by the uniform [`maxPlayerHealth`](/current/reference/uniforms/status#maxplayerhealth).

----------------


## maxPlayerHealth <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float maxPlayerHealth;
```
This value stores the maximum player health value, which is twice the number of maximum hearts (one value for each half-heart). The value is `-1` in creative and spectator modes. In a default survival world this value is `20` unless changed by mods or effects like [Health Boost](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Health_Boost), in which case the maximum value can be up to `1024`. This value is not affected by the [Absorption](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Absorption) effect, such as with golden apples.

----------------


## currentPlayerHunger <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float currentPlayerHunger;
```
This value stores the relative player hunger ranging from `0` to `1`. That means when the player is at full hunger, this value is `1`, and when they are at empty hunger the value is `0`. The value is `-1` in creative and spectator modes. To absolute hunger of the player, multiply this value by the uniform [`maxPlayerHunger`](/current/reference/uniforms/status#maxplayerhunger).

----------------


## maxPlayerHunger <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
```glsl
uniform float maxPlayerHunger;
```
This value stores the maximum player hunger value, which is twice the number of hunger icons in the user interface (one value for each half-hunger icon). In a default survival world this value is `20` unless changed by mods. Modes without hunger (such as creative and spectator modes) will still indicate the same maximum hunger value.

----------------
