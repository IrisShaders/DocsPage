### `const int shadowMapResolution = 1024;`

**Location**: any GLSL file

---

Sets the resolution for [`shadowtex`](/current/reference/buffers/shadowtex) and [`shadowcolor`](/current/reference/buffers/shadowcolor) buffers used in the [shadow pass](/current/reference/programs/shadow). These buffers are always square, so the value applies to both x and y axes. The default value is 1024.
