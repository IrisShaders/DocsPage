### `const float entityShadowDistanceMul = 1.0;`

#### Location: composite, deferred, final, prepare

This value controls the bounds for entity shadows to be rendered. By default, it is the value set for terrain. Any floating point number that is not 1 is multiplied by the terrain distance to get the final shadow distance multiplier.
