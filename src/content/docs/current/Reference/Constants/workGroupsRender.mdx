#### `const vec2 workGroupsRender = vec2(<x_mult>, <y_mult>);`

#### Location: any compute shader

Used to define number of work groups in a compute shader based on a multiple of the screen resolution. Replace `<x_mult>` and `<y_mult>` with a multiplier for each screen dimension. For example, `1.0` would mean there would be the same number of work groups in that dimension as pixels in the screen in that dimension. For more info, see the [Compute Shader](/current/reference/programs/overview#compute-shaders) section.
