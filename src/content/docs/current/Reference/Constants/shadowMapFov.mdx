Sets the FOV (field of view) for the shadow pass.

By default the shadow map uses orthographic rendering, which produces directional shadows which don't appear to come from a single point but instead a direction. Setting the FOV value however will change the rendering to a projection similar to the primary scene camera. This can be used to produce projected scene-like rendering similar to the [gbuffers](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) programs, but from the [shadow pass](/current/reference/programs/shadow).
