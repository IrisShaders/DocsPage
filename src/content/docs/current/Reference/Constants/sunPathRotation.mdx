### `const float sunPathRotation = 0.0;`

**Location**: any GLSL file

Sets the angle rotation in degrees of the sun/moon perpendicular to their direction of travel. The default value of `0.0` has the sun/moon travel in the highest arch directly over the top of the sky dome. A larger value (negative or positive) will rotate that path such that it does not cross directly over the top of the sky dome.
