The code contained in a shader pack is not the final code that is compiled and executed. In order to ensure maximum compatibility, Iris runs the shader code through [glsl-transformer](https://github.com/IrisShaders/glsl-transformer), which generates **patched shader code**. This is the code that actually ends up on the GPU. In the context of developing shaders, there are several important consequences to note:

- Since the patcher removes non-necessary whitespace in the code, line numbers in errors will not match up with the line numbers in your code
- You cannot name your functions or variables in a similar manner as internal Iris variables:
    - `iris_`
    - `irisMain`
    - `moj_import`
- The patcher will sometimes fix code that should otherwise fail
- Conversely, the patcher may not be flawless. If you're experiencing a bug and have exhausted all other possibilites, its worth checking the patched shader code

:::tip
When [debug mode](/current/reference/miscellaneous/patcher) is enabled, the patched shader code can be found in the `/patched_shaders/` folder in the root of your Minecraft directory.
