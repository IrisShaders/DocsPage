The `block.properties` file (located in the `shaders` folder) lets you assign IDs to specific blocks/block entities by their Minecraft ID. These IDs can be read through [`mc_Entity`](/current/reference/attributes/mc_entity) and [`blockEntityId`](/current/reference/uniforms/id#blockentityid) respectively in [gbuffers](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) and [shadow](/current/reference/programs/shadow) shaders. The `block.properties` file should be placed in the `shaders` folder.

Blocks and block entities can be assigned to an ID in this file, with the following syntax:
```properties title="block.properties"
block.<ID> = [<namespace>:]<block_id>[:<property1>=<value1>,...[:<property2>=<value1>,...]]

# for example
block.5 = stone minecraft:oak_trapdoor:open=true
block.6 = minecraft:oak_door:facing=north,south:hinge=right
```

The optional namespace allows support for modded blocks/block entities. Multiple blocks/block entities can be assigned to a single ID, however a single block/block entity can only be assigned to a single ID. Since Iris 1.3, IDs are stored internally as 16-bit signed integers, and can store values between `-32768` and `32767`. Prior to Iris 1.3 they were unsigned 16-bit, while Optifine has always used signed 16-bit.

### Block Properties
Block property values can optionally be specified with the `<property>=<value>` NBT format. They can be used to specify specific states for some blocks, for example redstone which is on/off, orientation for slabs/stairs, etc. For more info on block properties, see the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_states).

Multiple values for a property can be selected by listing them separated by commas (for example `minecraft:oak_door:facing=north,south`). This assigns the block ID to blocks whose property is either value.

Multiple properties can also be selected for by appending `:<property>=<value>` (for example `minecraft:oak_door:facing=north:hinge=right`). This assigns the block ID only to blocks which match both properties.

The two can also be combined, for example `minecraft:oak_door:facing=north,south:hinge=right` selects oak doors that are facing north or south, and that have hinges on their right side.


## Data Pack Tags

Iris 1.7 adds support for data pack tags, which allow assigning groups of block based on attributes of the block. For more info on tags, see the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tag#Java_Edition_2).

To specify a tag, use the following syntax `%<tag>` instead of the old block ID syntax. Use the [`IRIS_TAG_SUPPORT`](/current/reference/macros/iris_tag_support) macro in block.properties to detect if the current version of Iris supports tags:
```properties title="block.properties"  
#ifdef IRIS_TAG_SUPPORT
  block.<ID> = %[<namespace>:]<tag>
#endif

# for example
#if IRIS_TAG_SUPPORT >= 2
  block.9 = %minecraft:leaves %logs
#endif
```

## Render Layers

Using render layers, you can change which [gbuffers program](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) specific blocks render in. For example, this would allow a normally translucent block to be rendered as cutout or solid. This is accomplished by changing the program the block is rendered to according to the following table:

| layer                     | program                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `solid`                   | `gbuffers_terrain_solid`  |
| `cutout` / `cutout_mipped`| `gbuffers_terrain_cutout` |
| `translucent`             | `gbuffers_water`          |

> Note: there is no difference between `cutout` and `cutout_mipped` in Iris.

The following lines can be placed in `block.properties` to change the render layer of any list of `<blocks>` (defined in the same was as blockIDs):

```properties title="block.properties"
layer.solid=<blocks>
layer.cutout=<blocks>
layer.cutout_mipped=<blocks>
layer.translucent=<blocks>
```

<Aside type="caution">The render layer does not affect in-game culling, so making opaque geometry translucent might introduce holes in the world.</Aside>
