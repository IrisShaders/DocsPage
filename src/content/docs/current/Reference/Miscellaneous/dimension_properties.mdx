The `dimension.properties` file (located in the `shaders` folder) controls which shader files are loaded based on the dimension the player is in. The syntax is as follows:

```properties title=dimension.properties
dimension.<folder_name> = [<namespace>:]<dimension_name> ...

# for example
dimension.netherShaders = minecraft:the_nether
dimension.supportsShadows = minecraft:the_overworld minecraft:the_end *
```

Replace:
- `<folder_name>` with the folder name containing the shaders files (located in the `shaders` folder). The folder name can be anything.
- `<namespace>` optionally with `minecraft` a mod to specify namespace.
- `<dimension_name>` with the dimension ID as defined in Minecraft. `*` can also be used as a wildcard (any dimensions not already defined).

Any dimensions which are not specified (if a wildcard `*` is not used) will use the shader files located directly in the `shaders` folder.

OptiFine defines a standard for dimensions based on the legacy dimension number. Within the `shaders` folder, shaders in `world0` are loaded in the Overworld (or modded dimensions), `world-1` in the Nether, and `world1` in the End. If any `worldN` folders are present, then shaders will *only* be loaded from `worldN` folders (no shaders will be loaded from the base `shaders` folder).
