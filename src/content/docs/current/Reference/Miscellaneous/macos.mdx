Apple does not provide support for OpenGL past version 4.1 on macOS. Additionally, due to the closed-source nature of macOS, it is impossible to use third-party drivers. As a result, any feature implemented in OpenGL 4.2 or later is not available natively on macOS. Notable missing features include:

- [compute shaders](/current/reference/programs/overview#compute-shaders)
- [custom images](/current/reference/buffers/custom_images)
- [SSBOs](/current/reference/buffers/ssbo)
- [atomic counting](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Atomic_Counter)

Additionally, macOS only provides 8 colortex buffers, as opposed to the standard 16.

### Workarounds

:::caution[Here be dragons!]
These workarounds are experimental, and as such, subject to crashes, bugs, and general instability. Iris is not designed with these workarounds in mind, and any Iris-specific bugs caused by them will likely never be fixed.

If you are on macOS and want to develop a shader that requires OpenGL 4.2+ exclusive features, there exist several possible ways to achieve this:

- [Zink](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html#apple-macos-and-moltenvk)
- [Whisky / GPTK](https://getwhisky.app)
- Virtual Machines
    - [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/)
    - [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)
- [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org)

These solutions have not been tested by the authors of these docs. You're on your own!
