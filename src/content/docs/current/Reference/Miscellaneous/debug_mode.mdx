Iris provides a debug mode with several features to facilitate development of shaders. Debug mode can be enabled in two ways:

1. In the in-game Shader Selection screen (`Options > Video Settings > Shader Packs`, default keybind <kbd>O</kbd>) press <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> (Windows / Linux) or <kbd>Cmd + D</kbd> (macOS)
2. Set the `enableDebugOptions` field to `true` in Iris's settings file (`/config/iris.properties`)

Debug mode's features are as follows:

- **Pretty printing**: code generated by the [Iris patcher](/current/reference/miscellaneous/patcher) is saved to `/patched_shaders/`
- **Error window**: when an error in a shader is encountered, the error is presented to a pop-up window in-game
- **Parity**: patched shader code more accurately represents the source code. As of right now, this only prevents the patcher from deleting unused functions
