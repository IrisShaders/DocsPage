[Vivecraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/vivecraft) is a mod which allows to play Minecraft in VR. Vivecraft provides a few macros and uniforms to inform shaders about the current render state.  
Data mentioned here is managed by Vivecraft itself, so if any issues are encountered with it please report them on their [issue tracker](https://github.com/Vivecraft/VivecraftMod/issues)

## Definitions/Properties
### Checking for Vivecraft

All programs and properties have the `VIVECRAFT` define set if the Vivecraft mod is loaded. This also applies when VR is not used.

### Renderpasses

The uniform [`vivecraftRenderpass`](#vivecraftrenderpass) stores the renderpass of the currently rendered view. This can be used to apply special effects per renderpass. The following renderpasses are defined by Vivecraft as preprocessor macros:

| define                   | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_LEFT      | renders the left eye perspective                                 |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_RIGHT     | renders the right eye perspective                                |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_CENTER    | renders the first person slow mirror                             |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_THIRD     | renders the third person slow mirror                             |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_GUI       | draws the Minecraft gui/hud (not actually usable by shaders)     |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_SCOPER    | renders the main hand spyglass perspective                       |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_SCOPEL    | renders the offhand spyglass perspective                         |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_CAMERA    | renders the screenshot camera perspective                        |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_MIRROR    | shows the mirror on the desktop (not actually usable by shaders) |
| VIVECRAFT_PASS_VANILLA   | renders the vanilla perspective, set when VR is not used         |

## Uniforms

### vivecraftIsVR

#### Declaration

```glsl
uniform bool vivecraftIsVR;
```

This uniform specifies if the player is currently in VR.

### vivecraftRenderpass

#### Declaration

```glsl
uniform int vivecraftRenderpass;
```

This uniform specifies the current renderpass that Vivecraft is rendering. The uniform value is intended to be compared to one of the [renderpass preprocessor macros](#renderpasses) which are defined by Vivecraft.

### Hand Positions

#### Declaration

```glsl
uniform vec3 vivecraftRelativeMainHandPos;
uniform vec3 vivecraftRelativeOffHandPos;
```

These store the world space offsets from the player's hand position to the camera's position. (ie [`cameraPosition`](/current/reference/uniforms/camera#cameraposition)` - handPosition`)

### Hand Orientations

#### Declaration

```glsl
uniform mat4 vivecraftRelativeMainHandRot;
uniform mat4 vivecraftRelativeOffHandRot;
```

These matrices contain the player hand orientations in world space. This is a 3x3 rotation matrix in a mat4, it can be safely cast to a `mat3`.
