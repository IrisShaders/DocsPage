[Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons) is a mod which enables far greater render distances through the use of LODs. Iris allows shaders to integrate with this mod, ensuring that the blend between the vanilla terrain and the DH terrain can be seamless.

## Programs
:::danger
All Distant Horizons programs must use the `compatibility` profile.
:::

### Terrain
Terrain gets the program `dh_terrain`. This runs before normal terrain.

### Water
Water gets the program `dh_water`.  This runs before normal water.

### Shadow
Shadow pass gets the program `dh_shadow`. This runs before shadow terrain and shadow water respectively. 
:::note
The shadow pass retains the normal textures and projection.
:::

## Attributes
The following attributes are supported in DH programs:

`gl_Vertex`
`gl_MultiTexCoord2`
`gl_Normal`
`gl_Color`
`dhMaterialId`

The following built in uniforms are supported:

`gl_ModelViewMatrix(Inverse, etc)`
`gl_ProjectionMatrix(Inverse, etc)`
`gl_NormalMatrix`

## Definitions/Properties

### Enabling the DH shadow pass

The DH shadow pass is **automatically enabled**. It can be turned on or off with the shader property `dhShadow.enabled`.

**Distant Horizons has no set shadow distance; all chunks will be rendered.**

### Checking for Distant Horizons

All programs and properties have the `DISTANT_HORIZONS` define set if DH is enabled.

## Samplers

### Depth textures

There are two depth textures attached to Distant Horizons;

`dhDepthTex0` and `dhDepthTex1`. These behave identically to their non-DH counterparts, except they have different near/far planes (explained below) and only contain DH terrain/water.

## Uniforms

### dhNearPlane

```glsl
uniform float dhNearPlane;
```

This uniform specifies the near plane of DH's projection. **This does not apply to the shadow pass.**

### dhFarPlane

```glsl
uniform float dhFarPlane;
```

This uniform specifies the far plane of DH's projection. **This is not the render distance! Use `dhRenderDistance` for that.**

### dhRenderDistance

```glsl
uniform int dhRenderDistance;
```

This uniform specifies the render distance currently set in DH.

### dhProjection and variants

```glsl
uniform mat4 dhProjection;
uniform mat4 dhProjectionInverse;
uniform mat4 dhPreviousProjection;
```

This is the projection matrix for the non-shadow pass of Distant Horizons. This includes a different near and far plane, see the uniforms above.

## Block IDs

**Normal block IDs (`mc_Entity`) are not supported.**

Iris provides "mini-IDs" in the form of `int dhMaterialId` automatically declared.

All Mini-ID's get their own definitions that can be used in any program.

```text
DH_BLOCK_UNKNOWN // Any block not in this list that does not emit light
DH_BLOCK_LEAVES // All types of leaves, bamboo, or cactus
DH_BLOCK_STONE // Stone or ore
DH_BLOCK_WOOD // Any wooden item
DH_BLOCK_METAL // Any block that emits a metal or copper sound.
DH_BLOCK_DIRT // Dirt, grass, podzol, and coarse dirt.
DH_BLOCK_LAVA // Lava.
DH_BLOCK_DEEPSLATE // Deepslate, and all it's forms.
DH_BLOCK_SNOW // Snow.
DH_BLOCK_SAND // Sand and red sand.
DH_BLOCK_TERRACOTTA // Terracotta.
DH_BLOCK_NETHER_STONE // Blocks that have the "base_stone_nether" tag.
DH_BLOCK_WATER // Water...
DH_BLOCK_AIR // Air. This should never be accessible/used.
DH_BLOCK_ILLUMINATED // Any block not in this list that emits light
```
