### `uniform sampler2D depthtexN;`

There are three samplers for accessing the depth buffer.
- `depthtex0` includes all geometry
- `depthtex1` excludes transparent geometry
- `depthtex2` excludes transparent and hand geometry

These buffers can be read from any program, but will contain garbage data until the respective `gbuffers` shader has executed. For example, `depthtex1` will first contain meaningful data in the [`deferred`](/current/reference/programs/deferred) stage.

#### Writing

These buffers are automatically written to by [`gbuffers`](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) programs, and store the screenspace z coordinate at each pixel. You can manually write to this buffer by setting the `gl_FragDepth` variable in any `gbuffers` fragment shader. If `gl_FragDepth` is used in a shader, the automatic writing will be disabled and the shader is responsible for writing all depth values.

#### Size

These buffers are the same resolution as the Minecraft window. This cannot be configured.

#### Format / precision

These buffers only store information in a single channel, the `r` component. The depth buffer precision is hardware / driver dependent. However, most hardware uses either 24-bit or 32-bit (`R24` or `R32`) precision. 

:::tip
The default (automatic) behavior of writing to the depth buffer is as follows:
```glsl
gl_FragDepth = gl_FragCoord.z;
```

#### Clearing

All these buffers clear to `vec4(1.0)`. This cannot be configured.

#### Flipping

These buffers do not flip.

#### Aliases <Badge text="Legacy" variant="danger" size="medium" />
`depthtex0` can be accessed through the legacy alias `gdepthtex`.
