The coordinates used to sample the texture atlases in a gbuffers pass are obtained in the vertex shader using the following code:

```glsl title="Compatibility Profile"
coord = (gl_TextureMatrix[0] * gl_MultiTexCoord0).xy;
```
```glsl title="Core Profile"
coord = (textureMatrix * vec4(vaUV0, 0.0, 1.0)).xy;
```

For more information, see [`vaUV0`](http://localhost:4321/current/reference/attributes/vauv0/).

Texture atlases are *not bound* in non-gbuffers passes. To access them in other passes, [custom textures](/current/reference/buffers/custom_textures/#texture-types) can be used.

### `uniform sampler2D gtexture`
`gtexture` is the main texture atlas, used to obtain the albedo color of any geometry rendered in a gbuffers pass. It is usually multiplied by the result of [`gl_Color`](/current/reference/attributes/overview/)/[`vaColor`](/current/reference/attributes/vacolor/) (passed through from the vertex shader) to obtain the final color value. 

:::caution[Warning]
Some shaderpacks may use other aliases such as `tex`, as samplers using texture names that do not exist will simply bind to the atlas. *This is undefined behavior and should not be relied upon.*

`texture` is a valid alias in `#version 120`, however in any newer version of GLSL this is a reserved keyword and should not be used.

### `uniform sampler2D normals`
`normals` is the normal map atlas. If the resource pack does not have a texture suffixed with `_n` for the current geometry, or there is no resource pack loaded, then the value returned will be as follows.

| Component | Value (0-255) |
|-----------|---------------|
| `r`       | 127           |
| `g`       | 127           |
| `b`       | 255           |
| `a`       | 255           |

*Note that the values returned when sampling the texture are in the 0-1 range, whereas they are displayed here in the 0-255 range.*

For information on how to use these values, see [PBR Standards](/current/how-to/pbr_standards/).

### `uniform sampler2D specular`
`specular` is the specular map atlas. If the resource pack does not have a texture suffixed with `_s` for the current geometry, or there is no resource pack loaded, then the value returned will be as follows.

| Component | Value (0-255) |
|-----------|---------------|
| `r`       | 0             |
| `g`       | 0             |
| `b`       | 0             |
| `a`       | 0             |

*Note that the values returned when sampling the texture are in the 0-1 range, whereas they are displayed here in the 0-255 range.*
