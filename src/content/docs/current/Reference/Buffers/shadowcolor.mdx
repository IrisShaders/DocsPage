### `uniform sampler2D shadowcolorN;`
### `layout (<format>) uniform image2D shadowcolorimgN;`

The shadow pass supplies two color attachments for outputing color/data, `shadowcolor0` and `shadowcolor1`. These buffers can be read from any program, and can be written to from the fragment stage of the [`shadow`](/current/reference/programs/shadow) and [`shadowcomp`](/current/reference/programs/shadow_comp) programs. 

#### Writing
Any [`shadow`](/current/reference/programs/shadow) or [`shadowcomp`](/current/reference/programs/shadow_comp) program can write to a shadowcolor buffer. The buffers to write to can be selected with the [`RENDERTARGETS`](/current/reference/constants/rendertargets) or [`DRAWBUFFERS`](/current/reference/constants/drawbuffers) directive.

Additionally, you can read and write to `shadowcolor0` and `shadowcolor1` using the image bindings `shadowcolorimg0` through `shadowcolorimg1` in any program. This is the only way to write to shadowcolor buffers from compute shaders. For more information on image load/store, see the [Khronos Wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Image_Load_Store).

#### Size
These buffers default to the shadow pass resolution, which can be controlled with the [`shadowMapResolution`](/current/reference/constants/shadowmapresolution) constant.

#### Format / precision
These buffers default `RGBA` format (which defaults to `RGBA8` on most systems), but this can be configured as described in the [Texture Formats](/current/reference/buffers/image_format) section.

#### Clearing
By default these buffers clear their values after each frame to solid white (`vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)`). This behavior can be configured with the [`shadowcolorNClear`](/current/reference/constants/buffer_clear) directive, and the clear color can be configured with the [`shadowcolorNClearColor`](/current/reference/constants/buffer_clear_color) directive.

#### Flipping
Each shadowcolor sampler actually contains two buffers, which allows you to read from and write to the same buffer in the same pass. The buffer flipping behavior can be controlled with the [`flip.<program>.<buffer>`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/rendering#flip) directive.

#### Aliases <Badge text="Legacy" variant="danger" size="medium" />
The sampler `shadowcolor0` is also accessible through the legacy alias `shadowcolor`.

#### Extended shadowcolor <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
The [Feature Flag](/current/reference/shadersproperties/flags) `HIGHER_SHADOWCOLOR` enables additional shadowcolor buffers, `shadowcolor2` through `shadowcolor7`. These are identical to the other shadowcolor buffers outside of their name.
