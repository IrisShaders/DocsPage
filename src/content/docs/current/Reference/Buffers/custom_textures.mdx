Iris/OptiFine allows binding a texture to an existing sampler (such as a [colortex](/current/reference/buffers/colortex) sampler). This allows the shader to access images/data included with the shader pack, textures from the resource pack / game files, atlas textures, and more. The following directive can be put in the [shaders.properties](/current/reference/shadersproperties/overview) file to set up a custom texture:

```properties title="shaders.properties"
texture.<stage>.<bufferName> = <path>
```

### Texture types
OptiFine/Iris support four different texture types, which are specified in the `<path>` parameter.

#### Images from shader files
Image files can be loaded from the shader pack files by replacing `<path>` with the file path to the image relative to the `shaders` folder. For example `texture.composite.colortex5 = textures/perlin.png` would load `perlin.png` from the `shaders/textures` folder. Iris supports only `.png` image format, whereas OptiFine supports `.png` and `.jpg` formats.

#### Textures from game files / resource packs
Textures can also be loaded from the resource pack by replacing `<path>` with `minecraft:` followed by the path in the resource pack (or vanilla files) of the texture. For example, `texture.deferred.colortex7 = minecraft:textures/block/dirt.png` will load the dirt texture from the resource pack or vanilla assets.

#### Atlas and dynamic textures
Atlas textures (such as the block atlas) can be loaded by passing their file path, starting with `minecraft:textures/atlas/`. For example, `texture.composite.colortex9 = minecraft:textures/atlas/blocks.png` loads the block atlas into `colortex9`. A list of available texture atlases can be found in the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Texture_atlas#Navigation) under "Procedurally-generated" in the Navigation table.

Additionally, the lightmap dynamic texture can be loaded using either `minecraft:dynamic/lightmap_1` or `minecraft:dynamic/light_map_1`. This texture is equivalent to the `lightmap` sampler used in [gbuffers](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers). For example `texture.prepare.colortex2 = minecraft:dynamic/lightmap_1` loads the lightmap into `colortex2`. 

#### Raw textures
Raw textures can be loaded from the shader files, similarly to image files. However raw textures are uncompressed binary files, where the bytes represent the values in the texture directly. Raw files can also encode 3D textures, and the texture format can be directly controlled (images are always loaded as RGBA8). To use a raw texture, add the following parameters to the custom texture directive:

```properties  title="shaders.properties" ins="<type> <internalFormat> <dimensions> <pixelFormat> <pixelType>"
texture.<stage>.<bufferName> = <path> <type> <internalFormat> <dimensions> <pixelFormat> <pixelType>
```

Replace:
- `<type>` with one of the following: `TEXTURE_1D`, `TEXTURE_2D`, `TEXTURE_3D`, or `TEXTURE_RECTANGLE`.
- `<internalFormat>` with the [texture format](/current/reference/buffers/image_format).
- `<dimensions>` with the fixed size dimensions of the texture (the number of components depends on the type).
- `<pixelFormat>` with the pixel format described in the "Pixel Formats" section of the [texture format section](/current/reference/buffers/image_format).
- `<pixelType>` with the pixel type described in the "Pixel Types" section of the [texture format section](/current/reference/buffers/image_format).


### PBR textures
For any resource pack or atlas texture, the normal or specular versions of the textures (if they exist) can be loaded by appending the `_n` or `_s` suffix respectively. For example, `texture.deferred.colortex2 = minecraft:textures/atlas/blocks_s.png` loads the specular block atlas.


### Stage binding
The OptiFine specification for custom textures overwrites the binding of an existing sampler with the new texture. This means the texture originally in the sampler is no longer accessible. Iris adds the [`customTexture` directive](#customtexture-directive) which creates a new sampler, thus avoiding this issue.

When using the OptiFine specification, replace `<stage>` with the stage of programs which the texture will be bound in. During that stage, the sampler specified with `<bufferName>` will sample the custom texture rather than its original texture. The following options are available for `<stage>`:

| Name         | Description                                                                                    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setup`      | [`setup`](/current/reference/prorgams/setup) programs <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="small" />                             |
| `begin`      | [`begin`](/current/reference/programs/begin) programs <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="small" />                              |
| `shadowcomp` | [`shadowcomp`](/current/reference/programs/shadow_comp) programs                                       |
| `prepare`    | [`prepare`](/current/reference/programs/prepare) programs                                              |
| `gbuffers`   | [`gbuffers`](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) and [`shadow`](/current/reference/programs/shadow) programs |
| `deferred`   | [`deferred`](/current/reference/programs/deferred) programs                                            |
| `composite`  | [`composite`](/current/reference/programs/composite) and [`final`](/current/reference/programs/final) programs |


## `customTexture` directive <Badge text="Iris Exclusive" variant="tip" size="medium" />
Iris adds support for the `customTexture` directive, which allows a custom texture to be accessed via a different sampler instead of overriding an existing sampler. This allows creation of a sampler of (mostly) any name, which replaces `<name>` in the directive and is used in the shader code. Otherwise, the syntax of the enhanced custom textures are identical to standard custom textures.

```properties title="shaders.properties"
customTexture.<name> = <path>
customTexture.<name> = <path> <type> <internalFormat> <dimensions> <pixelFormat> <pixelType>
```

```glsl title="shader code"
uniform sampler2D <name>;
uniform sampler<dimensions> <name>; // Raw textures may create sampler1D, sampler2D, sampler3D, or sampler2DRect
```


## .mcmeta File
Hardware bilinear filtering and wrapping/clamping behavior can be controlled with a `.mcmeta` file with the same filename as the texture with `.mcmeta` appended (for example `perlinNoise.png.mcmeta`). The mcmeta file should be located in the same folder as the texture itself. The syntax is as follows:

```json title=".mcmeta file"
{
  "texture":
  {
    "blur": <true|false>,
    "clamp": <true|false>
  }
}
```

- `blur` controls texture filtering
    - `true` is bilinear
    - `false` is nearest neighbor
- `clamp` controls edge behavior
    - `true` clamps at the edges
    - `false` wraps at the edges

By default, image files will use nearest neighbor and wrapping, and raw textures will use bilinear filtering and clamping. Shader provided mcmeta files cannot be used for resource pack / atlas textures.
