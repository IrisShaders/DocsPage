### `uniform sampler2D colortexN;`
### `layout (<format>) uniform image2D colorimgN;`

There are 16 color attachments available through the `colortex0` through `colortex15` samplers. These samplers can be read from any program, and can be written to from the fragment stage of any [`begin`](/current/reference/programs/begin), [`prepare`](/current/reference/programs/prepare), [`gbuffers`](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers), [`deferred`](/current/reference/programs/deferred), or [`composite`](/current/reference/programs/composite) program. 

#### Writing
Any [`begin`](/current/reference/programs/begin), [`prepare`](/current/reference/programs/prepare), [`gbuffers`](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers), [`deferred`](/current/reference/programs/deferred), or [`composite`](/current/reference/programs/composite) program can write to a colortex buffer, the buffers to write to can be selected with the [`RENDERTARGETS`](/current/reference/constants/rendertargets) or [`DRAWBUFFERS`](/current/reference/constants/drawbuffers) directive.

Additionally, you can read and write to the first 6 colortex buffer in OptiFine or any colortex buffer in Iris using `colorimgN` where `N` is replaced with the colortex index. This is the only way to write to colortex buffers from compute shaders, but also works in any program. For more information on image load/store, see the [Khronos Wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Image_Load_Store).

#### Size
These buffers default to the display resolution, although this can be configured with the [`size.buffer`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/rendering#sizebuffer) define in shaders.properties. However, changing the buffer size will prevent any [`gbuffer`](/current/reference/programs/gbuffers) program from writing to the texture.

#### Format / precision
These buffers all default to `RGBA` format (which is `RGBA8` on most systems), but this can be configured as described in the [Texture Formats](/current/reference/buffers/image_format) section.

#### Clearing

By default, these buffers have each value cleared to `vec4(0.0)` after every frame. There are two execptions:

- `colortex0` clears to the [`fogColor`](/current/reference/uniforms/rendering#fogcolor) with 1.0 alpha
- `colortex1` clears to `vec4(1.0)`.

Each buffer can have its clearing disabled with the [`colortexNClear`](/current/reference/constants/buffer_clear) directive. Additionally, the clear color can be configured with the [`colortexNClearColor`](/current/reference/constants/buffer_clear_color) directive.

#### Flipping
Each colortex sampler actually contains two buffers, which allows you to read from and write to the same buffer in the same pass. The buffer flipping behavior can be controlled with the [`flip.<program>.<buffer>`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/rendering#flip) directive.

#### Aliases <Badge text="Legacy" variant="danger" size="medium" />
The first 8 colortex buffers have legacy aliases, although their names are often confusing and their use is not recommended. Except as noted below, either name can be used interchangably. The names are as follows:

| ColorTex name | Legacy name |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| colortex0     | gcolor      |
| colortex1     | gdepth      |
| colortex2     | gnormal     |
| colortex3     | composite   |
| colortex4     | gaux1       |
| colortex5     | gaux2       |
| colortex6     | gaux3       |
| colortex7     | gaux4       |

:::note
If `gdepth` is defined anywhere in the shader and the texture format for `colortex1`/`gdepth` is `RGBA` (or not specifically set by the shader), Iris will upgrade the format to `RGBA32F`. This represents legacy behavior, where `gdepth` was used to store depth values.
