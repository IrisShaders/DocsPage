### `uniform sampler2D noisetex;`

This buffer stores a generated RGB white noise texture. The texture is always square, meaning its width and height are equal.

#### Writing

This buffer cannot be written to. It can, however, be replaced with a [custom noise texture](#custom-noise-texture) from an image file or raw buffer data.

#### Size

The resolution of this texture defaults to 256x256. This can be configured with the [`noiseTextureResolution`](/current/reference/constants/noisetextureresolution) constant.

#### Format / precision

This buffer uses the `RGB8` format. This cannot be configured.

#### Clearing

This buffer clears to random white noise data, or (if overwritten) the custom texture.

#### Flipping

This buffer does not flip.

## Custom noise texture
Similar to [custom textures](/current/reference/buffers/custom_textures), the `noisetex` texture can be overwritten with an image file from the shader files. The following line can be placed in [shaders.properties](/current/reference/shadersproperties/overview), where `<path>` is replaced with the file path of the image file relative to the `shaders` folder:

```properties title="shaders.properties"
texture.noise=<path>
```
