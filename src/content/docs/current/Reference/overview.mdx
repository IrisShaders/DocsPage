...to the Iris docs!

Iris is a shader loader that is integrated with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/), with support for modern shaders, built from the ground up for ease of use. Whether you're new to shader development, want to migrate your shader pack from OptiFine, or just need a refresher on what Iris can do, you can find everything you need to know right here.

:::tip
When developing shaders, its super helpful to have [debug mode](/current/reference/miscellaneous/debug_mode) enabled! Navigate to the shader selection screen in Minecraft, then press <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> (Windows and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd + D</kbd> (macOS). This gives you extra information that is useful for development.

If you can't find what you are looking for, reach out to us on the [Iris Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jQJnav2jPu).

### File structure

Unless otherwise noted, these docs assume the root directory (`/`) to be your Minecraft folder. The location of this folder depends on your OS and launcher of choice. Additionally, these docs utilize wildcard notation (`*`) to indicate multiple files (e.g., `*.fsh` means "all files that end with `.fsh`").
