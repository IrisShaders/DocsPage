Iris provides macros for each [OpenGL extension](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Extension) supported by the current system.

The macros are defined as `MC_` followed by the extension name. For example, `MC_GL_ARB_shader_texture_lod` is only defined if the `GL_ARB_shader_texture_lod` extension is supported.
