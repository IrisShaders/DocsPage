Macros are a way of getting data, typically metadata about Iris itself, Minecraft, or hardware. Macros have two distinct categories:
1. **Value** macros: Iris will set the value of a macro to some data.
2. **Boolean** macros: Iris will define a macro if its criteria is met. This can be tested using the `ifdef` and `ifndef` directives.
