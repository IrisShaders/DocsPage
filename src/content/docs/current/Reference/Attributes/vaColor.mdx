This attribute only works with the `core` profile in Minecraft 1.17 and newer. It is recommended to use the `compatibility` profile with Iris for better support.

### `in vec4 vaColor;`

**Valid Programs**: `gbuffers_*.vsh`, `shadow.vsh`

The vertex color attribute, equivalent to `gl_Color` from the `compatibility` profile.

The color attribute is often used to apply tints to colored blocks such as leaves, grass, water, etc. It also contains the [vanilla ambient occlusion](/current/reference/constants/ambientocclusionlevel) and, if enabled, the [old lighting](/current/reference/shadersproperties/features#oldlighting).

Enabling [`separateAo`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/features#separateao) will move the ambient occlusion from the `rgb` components of `vaColor` to the `a` component, which can be applied later like this:
```glsl
vec3 color = vaColor.rgb * vaColor.a;
```
