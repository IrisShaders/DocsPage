### `in vec2 mc_midTexCoord;`

**Valid Programs**: `gbuffers_*.vsh`, `shadow.vsh`

The texture UV coordinate of the center of the texture of the current quad.

:::note
This is calculated per-quad, so, for example, when rendering a slab block, `mc_midTexCoord` points to the center of the portion of the texture covered by the slab, not the center of the parent block's texture.
