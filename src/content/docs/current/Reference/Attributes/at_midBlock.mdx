The `xyz` components store the world/player space offset from the vertex's position to the center of the block in 1/64th block units. For example, the center position would be calculated like this:
```glsl
vec3 centerPosition = position + at_midBlock.xyz / 64.0;
```

In Iris 1.7 and newer, the `w` component stores the light level of the current block (without the influence of nearby light sources, range `0` to `15`). This can be used to tell if a block is emissive. It's recommended to use this together with [`BLOCK_EMISSION_ATTRIBUTE`](/current/reference/shadersproperties/flags).
