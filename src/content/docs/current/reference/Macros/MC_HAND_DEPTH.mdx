### `MC_HAND_DEPTH`

The clip space depth multiplier applied to geometry in [`gbuffers_hand`](/reference/programs/gbuffers) and [`gbuffers_hand_water`](/reference/programs/gbuffers).

The multiplier is applied in clip space automatically through the [projection matrix](/reference/uniforms/matrices#projectionMatrix]. When working backwards from the depth buffer, the multiplier should be applied in NDC space rather than screen space to produce the correct result, for example:

```glsl
float screenDepth = texture(depthtex0, texcoord).r;
float ndcDepth = (screenDepth * 2.0 - 1.0) / MC_HAND_DEPTH;
```
