:::caution[Warning]
**Aperture is still in early development and not for public use.** Things can and will change, and parts of this section may be incomplete or outright incorrect.
:::

Aperture is a new pipeline for Iris, set to be released with Iris 2.0.
- It uses pipeline code written by shader developers in TypeScript, allowing for fully customizable packs.
- It has a mod API that allows for mods to apply custom vertex formats, vertex transformations, and (basic) fragment warping without interfering with shader developers.
- It has no limits on the number of textures, buffers, or programs you can have, how complex they can be, or how they are running.
- It has a new shadow mapping system based on cascaded shadow maps, allowing shadow maps that reach far beyond what Optifine packs can without distortion.
- Packs written on Aperture use a modern version of OpenGL that can be translated to other API's in the future.

This serves as temporary documentation whilst Aperture is being developed.

## `pack.ts`
`pack.ts` is where the shaderpack is configured. All textures and programs are registered from here. When instantiating objects like textures and programs, options for them can be configured using builder syntax. For example, to set the format of a texture, I would call `.format(<FORMAT>)` on it. Once an object is built, the `.build()` function must be called. For example:

```ts
let sceneTex = new Texture("sceneTex")
  .format(Format.RGB16F)
  .clear(true)
  .build();
```

To see a list of builder functions that can be called on an object (and what can be passed to them), you can go to the type definition in `iris.d.ts`.

### Registering Textures
Textures are registered in the `setupShader` function. They are instantiated by creating a new `Texture` object, or alternatively: 
- `RawTexture` (which reads from a binary file)
- `ArrayTexture` (required for the shadow map)
- `PNGTexture` (guess what this does)

### Registering Programs
Shader programs are registered in the `setupShader` function with the `registerShader` function, which takes in one of the following

- `ObjectShader` ('gbuffers' style)
- `Composite` (fullscreen pass)
- `Compute`

`ObjectShader`s take a `programUsage`, these are predefined for you, for example `TERRAIN_SOLID`.

To add a vertex and fragment shader to your shader object, you can call `.vertex(<PATH_TO_VERTEX>)` and `.fragment(<PATH_TO_FRAGMENT>)`.

To choose which buffers the fragment shader writes to, use `.target(<index>, <texture>)` - `index` is the index in your `layout(location = <index>)` definition. This essentially replaces `RENDERTARGETS`.


:::caution[Warning]
You **must** register a combination pass, this is like `final` and writes the final color to the screen. This is done with `setCombinationPass()` which takes a `CombinationPass` object which itself takes the path to the fragment shader which handles this. Your combination program should provide an `out vec4 fragColor`, taking an `in vec2 uv`. This pass cannot write to any other buffers.
:::


## Writing Shader Programs

### Vertex Shaders
Vertex shaders should define two functions:

#### `void iris_emitVertex(inout VertexData data)`
Set `data.clipPos` as you would `gl_Position`. Usually this can just be `iris_projectionMatrix * iris_modelViewMatrix * data.modelPos`

:::note[Info]
`iris_projectionMatrix` and `iris_modelViewMatrix` are patched to make sense for the relevant usage, in the same way `gl_ModelViewMatrix` is in Optifine.
:::

#### `void iris_sendParameters(VertexData data)`
This is where you can write to your `out` declarations.

Both of these functions make use of the `VertexData` struct.

```glsl
struct VertexData {
	vec4 modelPos; // model space position you are given
	vec4 clipPos; // clip space position you must set
	vec2 uv; // texture coordinate in the atlas
	vec2 light; // lightmap texture coordinate - x is blocklight, y is skylight
	vec4 color; // vertex color, equivalent to gl_Color
	vec3 normal; // model space normal
	vec4 tangent; // model space tangent
	vec4 overlayColor; // stuff like the red damage flash, equivalent to entityColor
	vec3 midBlock; // equivalent to at_midBlock
	uint blockId; // hooray
	uint textureId; // ???
	float ao; // vanilla ambient occlusion
};
```

### Fragment Shaders

Fragment shaders are a lot simpler, you just define `void iris_emitFragment()` instead of `void main()`.

## Uniforms

:::caution[Warning]
Apart from samplers, uniforms are not declared within your shader. Instead, add them as arguments to the `registerUniforms()` function, called before `finalizeUniforms()` in `setupShader()`.
:::

### Matrices
Instead of `gbufferModelView` and `gbufferProjection` there is `playerModelView` and `playerProjection`. To access the previous frame versions, prefix `last` (maintaining camelCase). To access the inverse, suffix `Inverse`.

The shadow matrices have not been renamed, although currently `shadowModelViewInverse` does not exist for some reason.

### Uniforms which have not changed
- `isEyeInWater`
- `eyeBrightness`
- `shadowLightPosition`
- `sunPosition`
- `moonPosition`
- `moonPhase`
- `frameTime`
- `worldTime`
- `frameCounter`
- `skyColor`
- `fogColor`
- `fogStart`
- `fogEnd`
- `rainStrength`


### Uniforms Which Have Changed
- `cameraPosition` is now `cameraPos`. `previousCameraPosition` is likewise `lastCameraPos`.
- `far` is now `renderDistance`
- `near` is now `nearPlane`
- `sunAngle` is now `dayProgression`
- `frameTimeCounter` is now `timeCounter`
- `hideGUI` is now `guiHidden`
- `viewWidth` and `viewHeight` have been replaced with `screenSize`

### New Uniforms
- `farPlane`, the actual far plane
- `shadowProjectionSize`

Any uniforms not mentioned are probably not available yet.

## Shadows
Iris makes use of cascaded shadow maps, which means everything is a lot more complicated.

### Setting Up the Shadow Pass
You do not need to declare the shadow map, as it is automatically defined. If you want any `shadowcolor` style buffers, declare them as an `ArrayTexture`.

### Sampling the Shadow Map
Aperture defines two shadow maps.
- `shadowMap` (equivalent to `shadowtex0`)
- `solidShadowMap` (equivalent to `shadowtex1`)

Both of these should be defined as `sampler2DArray`s. To sample them, you pass the cascade as the `z` component of your coordinate, i.e:

```glsl
float shadow = step(shadowScreenPos.z, texture(shadowMap, vec3(shadowScreenPos.xy, cascade)));
```

Cascade 0 is the smallest, containing only a small area around the player, and cascade 3 is the largest.

Bear in mind that `shadowProjection` is also an array, because each cascade has a different projection. As such, to sample the shadow map, you must loop through each projection until your position is inside the frustum.

```glsl
int cascade;
for(cascade = 0; cascade < 4; cascade++){
	shadowClipPos = shadowProjection[cascade] * shadowViewPos;

	if(clamp(shadowClipPos.xy, vec2(-1.0), vec2(1.0)) == shadowClipPos.xy) break;
}
```

### Hardware Filtering
If you want hardware filtering, you can instead use a `sampler2DArrayShadow`. Due to reasons known only to the developers over at Khronos, the cascade is still the `z` component of the coordinate you pass in, so it becomes

```glsl
float shadow = texture(shadowMap, vec4(shadowScreenPos.xy, cascade, shadowScreenPos.z));
```
