Aperture is a new pipeline for Iris, set to be released with Iris 2.0.
- It uses pipeline code written by shader developers in TypeScript, allowing for fully customizable packs.
- It has a mod API that allows for mods to apply custom vertex formats, vertex transformations, and (basic) fragment warping without interfering with shader developers.
- It has no limits on the number of textures, buffers, or programs you can have, how complex they can be, or how they are running.
- It has a new shadow mapping system based on cascaded shadow maps, allowing shadow maps that reach far beyond what Optifine packs can without distortion.
- Packs written on Aperture use a modern version of OpenGL that can be translated to other API's in the future.

This serves as temporary documentation whilst Aperture is being developed.

## Uniforms

### Matrices
Instead of `gbufferModelView` and `gbufferProjection` there is `playerModelView` and `playerProjection`. To access the previous frame versions, prefix `last` (maintaining camelCase). To access the inverse, suffix `Inverse`.

The shadow matrices have not been renamed.

### Uniforms which have not changed
- `isEyeInWater`
- `eyeBrightness`
- `shadowLightPosition`
- `sunPosition`
- `moonPosition`
- `moonPhase`
- `frameTime`
- `worldTime`
- `frameCounter`
- `skyColor`
- `fogColor`
- `fogStart`
- `fogEnd`
- `rainStrength`


### Uniforms which have changed
- `cameraPosition` is now `cameraPos`. `previousCameraPosition` is likewise `lastCameraPos`.
- `far` is now `renderDistance`
- `frameTimeCounter` is now `timeCounter`
- `hideGUI` is now `guiHidden`
- `viewWidth` and `viewHeight` have been replaced with `screenSize`


### New Uniforms
- `dayProgression`, a `float` ranging from `0.0` to `1.0` to indicate the progression through the daylight cycle.
- `farPlane`, the actual far plane
- `nearPlane`
- `shadowProjectionSize`

Anything not mentioned is probably not available yet.
