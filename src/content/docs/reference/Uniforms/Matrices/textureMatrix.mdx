### `uniform mat4 textureMatrix;`

Transforms texture coordinates. Mainly used in [`gbuffers_armor_glint`](/reference/programs/gbuffers) to scroll the texture over time, but may be applied to other geometry as well (especially by mods). It is therefore strongly recommended to use this matrix in all [gbuffers-style](/reference/programs/overview/#program-order) programs utilizing [`vaUV0`](/reference/attributes/vauv0/).
```glsl
vec2 coord = (textureMatrix * vec4(vaUV0, 0.0, 1.0)).xy;
```
Equivalent to `gl_TextureMatrix[0]` in the compatibility profile and older GLSL versions.
```glsl
vec2 coord = (gl_TextureMatrix[0] * gl_MultiTexCoord0).xy;
```
