### `uniform mat4 gbufferProjection;`

Equal to the [`projectionMatrix`](/reference/uniforms/matrices/projectionmatrix) used by all [gbuffers programs](/reference/programs/gbuffers) except for `gbuffers_hand` and `gbuffers_hand_water`, where the [`projectionMatrix`](/reference/uniforms/matrices/projectionmatrix) multiplies the Z axis by `MC_HAND_DEPTH` to move the hand closer to the camera than the rest of the world.
