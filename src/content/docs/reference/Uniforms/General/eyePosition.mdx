### `uniform vec3 eyePosition;`

This value stores the world space position of the player's head model. When in first person view, this is equivalent to [`cameraPosition`](/reference/uniforms/general/cameraposition). However in third person mode the two will differ as the camera and player's head are now in different locations.
