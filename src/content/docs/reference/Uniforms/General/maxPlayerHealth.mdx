### `uniform float maxPlayerHealth;`

This value stores the maximum player health value, which is twice the number of maximum hearts (one value for each half-heart).  This value is `0` in modes without player health, such as creative and spectator modes. In a default survival world this value is `20` unless changed by mods or effects like potions or golden apples.
