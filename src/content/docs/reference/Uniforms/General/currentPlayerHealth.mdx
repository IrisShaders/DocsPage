### `uniform float currentPlayerHealth;`

This value stores the relative player health ranging from `0` to `1`. That means when the player is at full health, this value is `1`, and when they die this values reaches `0`. To absolute health of the player, multiply this value by the uniform `maxPlayerHealth`.
