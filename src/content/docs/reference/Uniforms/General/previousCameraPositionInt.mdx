### `uniform ivec3 previousCameraPositionInt;`

This uniform stores the integer component (truncated value) of the position of the player camera from the previous frame. Unlike [`previousCameraPosition`](/reference/uniforms/general/previouscameraposition), this value is not shifted and will exactly match the integer component of the player's coordinates in first person view.
