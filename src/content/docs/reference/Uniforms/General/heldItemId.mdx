### `uniform int heldItemId;`

This uniform stores the id (from [`item.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/item_properties)) of the item currently held in the main hand. Value is 0 if no [`item.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/item_properties) is present. Value is -1 if [`item.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/item_properties) is present and the player holds an item not in the file (this includes holding nothing).
