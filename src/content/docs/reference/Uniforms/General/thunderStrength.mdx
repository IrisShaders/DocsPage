### `uniform float thunderStrength;`

This value is equivalent to [rainStrength](/reference/uniforms/general/rainstrength) but is only non-zero when there is currently a thunder storm (e.g. weather set thunder). The value ranges between `0` to `1` where `0` means no thunder and `1` means thunder storm, the value is interpolated between those values during transitions in weather.
