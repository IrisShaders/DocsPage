### `uniform int biome_category;`

This uniform identifies the biome category currently occupied by the player. It's value can be compared with the same predefined constants as custom uniforms, the following are recognized:

`CAT_NONE`, `CAT_TAIGA`, `CAT_EXTREME_HILLS`, `CAT_JUNGLE`, `CAT_MESA`, `CAT_PLAINS`, `CAT_SAVANNA`, `CAT_ICY`, `CAT_THE_END`, `CAT_BEACH`, `CAT_FOREST`, `CAT_OCEAN`, `CAT_DESERT`, `CAT_RIVER`, `CAT_SWAMP`, `CAT_MUSHROOM`, `CAT_NETHER`

 This uniform functions similarly to the value available for custom unfiroms in Optifine, however Iris additionally provides them as standard uniforms.
