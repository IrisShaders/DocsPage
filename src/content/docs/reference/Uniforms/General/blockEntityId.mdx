### `uniform int blockEntityId;`

This uniform stores the id (from [`block.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties)) of the current block entity (a tile entity). Value is `0` if no [`block.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties) is present. Value is `65535` if [`block.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties) is present and the block is either not in the file, or not en entity (this includes holding nothing).
