### `uniform float wetness;`

This uniform outputs the current strength of rain and is non-zero when there is currently a rain storm (e.g. weather set rain). The value ranges between `0` to `1` where `0` means no rain and `1` means rain storm, the value is interpolated between those values during transitions in weather.
The transition is significantly slower, and can be controlled with [`wetnessHalfLife`](/reference/directives/constants/wetnesshalflife).
