### `uniform float sunAngle;`

This value represents the angle of the sun within the complete day-night cycle. The value ranges from `0` to `1`, where `0` is sunrise, `0.25` is noon, `0.5` is sunset, `0.75` is midnight, etc.

Since the night and day are slightly different lengths, the actual sunrise is at time `23215` and sunset at time `12785` (the times when the sun and moon are exactly equidistant at the horizon).
