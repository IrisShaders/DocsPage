### `uniform float nightVision;`

This value stores the night vision effect as a multiplier. It ranges from `0` to `1` where `0` is no night vision and `1` is full night vision. The uniform is only between `0` and `1` during transitions between having or not having night vision. More information on the blindness effect can be found at the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Night_Vision).
