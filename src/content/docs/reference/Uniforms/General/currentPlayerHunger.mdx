### `uniform float currentPlayerHunger;`

This value stores the relative player hunger ranging from `0` to `1`. That means when the player is at full hunger, this value is `1`, and when they are at empty hunger the value is `0`. To absolute hunger of the player, multiply this value by the uniform `maxPlayerHunger`.
