### `uniform int worldTime;`

This value stores the world time within the current day. This value is equivalent to the command `time query daytime`, and can range between `0` and `23999` and resets after each day.

Since the night and day are slightly different lengths, the actual sunrise is at time `23215` and sunset at time `12785` (the times when the sun and moon are exactly equidistant at the horizon).
