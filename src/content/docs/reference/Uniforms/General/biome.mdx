### `uniform int biome;`

This uniform identifies the biome currently occupied by the player. It's value can be compared with the same predefined constants as custom uniforms using biome, for example: `BIOME_PLAINS`, `BIOME_RIVER`, `BIOME_DESERT`, `BIOME_SWAMP`, etc. For more information on biomes, see the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome).

This uniform functions similarly to the value available for custom unfiroms in Optifine, however Iris additionally provides them as standard uniforms.
