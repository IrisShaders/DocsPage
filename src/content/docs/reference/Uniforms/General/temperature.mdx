### `uniform float temperature;`

This value stores the temperature property of the current biome as defined by Minecraft internally. In vanilla Minecraft this will range in value from `-0.7` to `2.0`, however mods may have values outside that range. For more information on biomes, see the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome).
