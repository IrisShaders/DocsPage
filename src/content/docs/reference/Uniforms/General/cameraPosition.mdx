### `uniform vec3 cameraPosition;`

This uniform stores the position of the camera in world space.

This is similar to the in game coordinates, except for precision reasons the value is wrapped after a large number of blocks. In modern Iris, the value will reset every `30000` blocks when walking, or if the player has teleported more than `1000` blocks. Optifine resets every `1000024` blocks.
