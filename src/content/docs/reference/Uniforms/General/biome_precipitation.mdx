### `uniform int biome_precipitation;`

This uniform identifies what type of precipitation occurs in this biome: `0` is no precipitation, `1` is rain, `2` is snow. The following defines can also be used: `PPT_NONE`, `PPT_RAIN`, `PPT_SNOW`.  For more information on biomes, see the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome).

This uniform functions similarly to the value available for custom unfiroms in Optifine, however Iris additionally provides them as standard uniforms.
