### `uniform float blindness;`

This value stores the blindness effect as a multiplier. It ranges from `0` to `1` where `0` is no blindness and `1` is full blindness. The uniform is only between `0` and `1` during transitions between having or not having blindness. More information on the blindness effect can be found at the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Blindness).
