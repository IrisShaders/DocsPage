### `uniform float alphaTestRef;`

This value stores the alpha value that Iris recommends you discard pixels bellow. This value is commonly `0.1`, but can change in certain cases. Therefore the uniform should be used. It is normally used like this:
```glsl
if (albedoOut.a < alphaTestRef) discard;
```
