### `uniform float alphaTestRef;`

This value stores the alpha value that Iris recommends you discard pixels bellow. This value is commonly `0.1`, but can change in certain cases (therefore it is recommended to use the uniform over a hardcoded value). The value is also affected by the [`alphaTest`](/reference/shadersproperties/alphatest) directive. It is normally used like this:
```glsl
if (albedoOut.a < alphaTestRef) discard;
```

<Aside type="note">This uniform is designed to work with the modern syntax for fragment shader outputs (`out`). When Using the legacy syntax (`gl_FragData`) this uniform is not necessary as the alpha test will be performed automatically.</Aside>
