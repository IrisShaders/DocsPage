### `uniform int currentSelectedBlockId;`

This uniform stores the id (from [`block.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties)) of the block selected by the player (with the block outline). Value is `0` if no block is selected, if the selected block is not in [`block.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties), or if no [`block.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties) is file present.
