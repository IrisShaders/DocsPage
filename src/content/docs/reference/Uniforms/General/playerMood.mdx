### `uniform float playerMood;`

The 'mood' value for the player. This value starts at `0.0`, and gradually increases over time. The rate at which the value increases is higher when the player is in a darker environment and there are less transparent blocks nearby. 

When this value hits `1.0`, a cave noise is played, and it is reset to `0.0`.
