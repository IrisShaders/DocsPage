### `uniform float playerMood;`

This uniform stores the player's mood value. This value increments when the player is in a cave (or any structure with low block and sky light). The value ranges between `0.0` and `1.0` and resets to `0.0` after it increments to `1.0`. More information on mood can be found at the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ambience#Cave_ambience).
