### `uniform float eyeAltitude;`

This uniform stores the float value of the altitude of the player, stored in blocks. This is equivalent to [`cameraPosition.y`](/reference/uniforms/general/cameraposition). This value matches the one displayed on the `f3` screen. For more information visit the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Altitude) article on altitude.
