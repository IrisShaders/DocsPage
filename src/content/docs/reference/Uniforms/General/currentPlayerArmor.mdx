### `uniform float currentPlayerArmour;`

This value stores the relative player armor value ranging from `0` to `1`. That means when the player wearing armor that completely fills the armor bar this value is `1`, and when they are not wearing any armor the value is `0`. To absolute armor value of the player, multiply this value by the uniform [`maxPlayerArmor`](/reference/uniforms/general/maxplayerarmor/).
