### `uniform float rainfall;`

This value stores the rainfall property of the current biome as defined by Minecraft internally, and ranges from `0` to `1`. This value does not depend on the current weather, but is a property of the biome. For more information on biomes, see the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome).
