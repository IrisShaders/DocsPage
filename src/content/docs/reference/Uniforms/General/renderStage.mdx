### `uniform int renderStage;`

This uniform stores the "render stage" of the current geometry. This can be used to identify what type of geometry is being rendered in more detail than the gbuffer program it's running in. The uniform value is intended to be compared to one of the following preprocessor macros which are defined by Iris:
