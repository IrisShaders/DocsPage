### `uniform int renderStage;`

This uniform stores the "render stage" of the current geometry. This can be used to identify what type of geometry is being rendered in more detail than the [gbuffer program](/reference/programs/gbuffers) it's running in. The uniform value is intended to be compared to one of the [render stage preprocessor macros](/reference/macros/render_stages) which are defined by Iris.
