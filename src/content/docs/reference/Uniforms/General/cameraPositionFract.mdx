### `uniform vec3 cameraPositionFract;`

This uniform stores the fractional component (`0` to `1`) of the position of the player camera. This value is intended to be used with [`cameraPositionInt`](/reference/uniforms/general/camerapositionint) to determine the exact player camera position without precision errors.
