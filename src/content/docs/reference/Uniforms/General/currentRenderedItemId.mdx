### `uniform int currentRenderedItemId;`

Iris allows detecting items and armor during rendering on *anything*.

Using `uniform int currentRenderedItemId;`, you can detect items and armor rendered in the level at the point of render (based on [`item.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/item_properties)). This is similar to [`heldItemId`](/reference/uniforms/general/helditemid) and [`heldItemId2`](/reference/uniforms/general/helditemid2), except it applies to the currently rendered item/armor instead of the held item.

There are some new ID's that can be detected alongside items and armor:

`trim_material` to detect armor trims on armor. (For example, `trim_emerald`).
