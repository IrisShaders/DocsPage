### `uniform vec3 shadowLightPosition;`

This value stores the position of the highest celestial body in view space. In the overworld, during the day `shadowLightPosition` is equivalent to [`sunPosition`](/reference/uniforms/general/sunposition) and during the night is equivalent to [`moonPosition`](/reference/uniforms/general/moonposition). This matches direction used for the shadow pass. The length of this value is always `100`, as it represents a position not a direction. This value can be converted to screen space directly to get the screen space position of the celestial body.
