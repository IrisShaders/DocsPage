### `uniform float currentPlayerAir;`

This value stores the relative player air when underwater ranging from `0` to `1`. That means when the player is at full air, this value is `1`, and when they are out of air (e.g. drowning) the value is `0`. To absolute air of the player, multiply this value by the uniform `maxPlayerAir`.
