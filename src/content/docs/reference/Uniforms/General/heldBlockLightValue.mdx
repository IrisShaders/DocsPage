### `uniform int heldBlockLightValue;`
The light strength of the item held in the player's hand. This ranges from `0`-`15` for vanilla blocks, however some modded blocks may have a higher value.

**Note:** if [`oldHandLight`](/reference/shadersproperties/oldhandlight) is not set to `false`, `heldBlockLightValue` will take its value from the hand with the highest light value for legacy support.
