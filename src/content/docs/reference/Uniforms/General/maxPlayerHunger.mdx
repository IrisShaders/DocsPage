### `uniform float maxPlayerHunger;`

This value stores the maximum player hunger value, which is twice the number of hunger icons in the user interface (one value for each half-hunger icon). In a default survival world this value is `20` unless changed by mods. Modes without hunger (such as creative and spectator modes) will still indicate the same maximum hunger value.
