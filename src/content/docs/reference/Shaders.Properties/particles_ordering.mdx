### `particles.ordering=<mixed|after|before>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

This controls how particles will be rendered. There are 3 possible options for this value.

- `mixed`: Opaque particles are rendered before the [deferred](/reference/programs/deferred) pass, and translucent particles are rendered after. This is the default if no [deferred](/reference/programs/deferred) passes are present.
- `after`: All particles are rendered after the [deferred](/reference/programs/deferred) pass. This is the default if there are any [deferred](/reference/programs/deferred) passes.
- `before`: All particles are rendered before the [deferred](/reference/programs/deferred) pass.
