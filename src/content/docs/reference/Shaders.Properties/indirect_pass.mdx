#### `indirect.<pass> = <bufferObjectNumber> <offsetInBuffer>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

Allows you to dispatch a compute shader with the work group amount specified from a [SSBO](/reference/buffers/ssbo).

To use this, replace:
- `<pass>` with the name of the compute shader pass (e.g. `composite`, `deferred1`, `prepare8`)
- `<bufferObjectNumber>` with the "index" of the SSBO
- `<offsetInBuffer>` with the offset to the work group count in bytes

The object at offset in the SSBO must be an `uvec3` which stores the number of work groups in each axis. ***If you do not do this, your PC will most likely crash trying to dispatch 2147483647^3 work groups. Don't do that.***
