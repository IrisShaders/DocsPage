### `skipAllRendering=<true|false>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

Disables most of the [gbuffers](/reference/programs/gbuffers) pass, including terrain, entities, and block entities. Does not disable post processing shaders or shadows.

This option is intended for path tracing packs which do not utilize the [gbuffers](/reference/programs/gbuffers) pass and wish to avoid that geometry being sent to the screen.
