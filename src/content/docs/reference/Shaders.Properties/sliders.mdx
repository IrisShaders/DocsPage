### `sliders = <list_of_options>`

The `sliders` directive is a list of non-boolean options which should be made into sliders. For more info on shader options, see [shaders.properties](/reference/shadersproperties/overview#shader-options)

Any options added to the `sliders` list will be displayed as sliders in the "Shader Pack Settings" screen and/or sub-screens. Any options which are not in the `sliders` list are treated as buttons, where clicking the buttons cycles through the option values. Sliders however let you drag a bar to change option values.

The values in the slider are defined by the commented value list where the option is defined. The order of values in the slider is determined **exclusively** by the order in the commented value list. For example if the list is not defined in numerical order the slider values will not be in numerical order.

There should only be one `sliders` list, and options from any sub-screens should be included in that single list (the sliders will still appear in the sub-screen they are defined in using [`screen`](/reference/shadersproperties/screen)).
