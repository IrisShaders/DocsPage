### `particles.before.deferred=<true|false>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

The legacy version of [`particles.ordering`](/reference/shadersproperties/particles_ordering) which is supported by Optifine. If set to `true` all particles will be rendered before the deferred pass, otherwise particles will be rendered after the deferred pass. This ordering is overwritten by [`particles.ordering`](/reference/shadersproperties/particles_ordering) by Iris if both are present.
