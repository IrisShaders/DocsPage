### `occlusion.culling=<true|false>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

Disables occlusion culling, which culls geometry which is behind other opaque geometry. Only applies to the main pass ([gbuffers](/reference/programs/gbuffers)).

Notably this affects whether caves are rendered when above ground, and whether the surface is rendered when deep in a cave. Disabling this may help reduce light leaking in caves by covering the top of the shadow map with the surface. However this also renders dramatically more terrain which can hurt performance.
