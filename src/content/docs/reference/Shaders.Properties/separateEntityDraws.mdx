### `separateEntityDraws=<true|false>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

If `separateEntityDraws` is true in shaders.properties, translucent entities and block entities will wait to be drawn until after the deferred pass, and then will be drawn in the `gbuffers_entities_translucent` and `gbuffers_block_translucent` programs.
