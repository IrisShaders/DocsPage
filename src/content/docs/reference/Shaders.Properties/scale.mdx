### `scale.<program>=<scale|scale offsetX ofsetY>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

Defines a new viewport for a composite style program. This does not affect the resolution of the output buffer, it only impacts the vertex position attribute, therefore only changing the portion of the texture which is rendered to. The same effect can be achieved by manually modifying the position in the vertex stage, this directive simply offers a different interface for changing the viewport.

Replace:
- `<program>` with a composite style program (composite, deferred, prepare, etc.)
- `<scale>` with a scaling factor from `0.0` to `1.0` which affects both axes
- optionally `<offsetX>` and `<offsetY>` with the horizontal offset in each direction from `0.0` to `1.0`
