### `uniform sampler2D shadowtexN;`

There are two samplers for accessing the shadow depth buffer.
- `shadowtex0` includes all geometry
- `shadowtex1` excludes transparent geometry

These buffers are written to by [`shadow`](/reference/programs/shadow) program, which renders the scene from the perspective of the sun or moon.

These buffers only store information in a single channel, the red component. The shadow buffer precision is hardware/driver dependent, however most hardware uses either 24-bit or 32-bit precision. The resolution of the shadow pass can be controlled with the `shadowMapResolution` constant.

#### Legacy Aliases
The alias `waterShadow` points to the same buffer as `shadowtex0`. If `waterShadow` is present anywhere in the code, then the alias `shadow` will point to the same buffer as `shadowtex1`, otherwise it will point to the buffer `shadowtex0`.
