##### `image.<imageName> = <samplerName> <format> <internalFormat> <pixelType> <shouldClearOnNewFrame> <isRelative> <relativeX/absoluteX> <relativeY/absoluteY> <absoluteZ>`

Custom images allow to write up to 8 custom full images of data. These images are similar to [colortex](/reference/buffers/colortex) buffers, except they allow for writing to arbitrary locations and from any shader file. For more info on allowed formats and restrictions, along for their use in shaders, read the [Khronos Wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Image_Load_Store). Iris custom images require the [`CUSTOM_IMAGES`](/reference/shadersproperties/flags) feature flag.

To declare a custom image, use the following in shaders.properties:

`image.<imageName> = <samplerName> <format> <internalFormat> <pixelType> <shouldClearOnNewFrame> <isRelative> <relativeX/absoluteX> <relativeY/absoluteY> <absoluteZ>`

Replace:
- `<imageName>` with the variable name of the image
- `<samplerName>` with the variable name of the sampler
- `<format>` with the [pixel format](/reference/buffers/texture_format) of the image (see "Pixel Formats" section)
- `<internalFormat>` with the [texture format](/reference/buffers/texture_format) of the image (see "Texture Format" section)
- `<pixelType>` with the [pixel type](/reference/buffers/texture_format) of the image (see "Pixel Types" section)
- `<shouldClearOnNewFrame>` with `true` to clear the image after each frame, or `false` to retain data between frames
- `<isRelative>` with `true` to make the image dimensions relative to the screen dimensions, or `false` to make the dimensions absolute
- `<relativeX/absoluteX>` with the relative (floating point) or absolute (integer) size in the x dimension
- `<relativeY/absoluteY>` with the relative (floating point) or absolute (integer) size in the y dimension
- `<absoluteZ>` with the absolute (integer) size in the z dimension

For example, to declare a `RGBA32F` custom image half the screen size that does not clear, use the following:

`image.cimage1 = cSampler1 rgba rgba32f float false true 0.5 0.5`

And to declare a `RGBA8` 3D custom image with dimensions of 512x512x512 that clears every frame:

`image.cimage1 = cSampler1 rgba rgba8 float true false 512 512 512`

This image can be accessed in 2 ways:

- The image can be written and read per-pixel by declaring it as an image:

```glsl
layout (rgba8) uniform image2D cimage1;

void main() {
    vec4 previousValue = imageLoad(cimage1, ivec2(0, 0)); // Reads from first pixel in the image
    imageStore(cimage1, ivec2(0, 0), vec4(1, 0, 0, 1)); // Writes to first pixel in the image
}
```

- Or the image can be read with filtering as a sampler:

```glsl
uniform sampler2D cSampler1;
varying float viewWidth;
varying float viewHeight;

void main() {
    gl_FragColor = texture2D(cSampler1, gl_FragCoord.xy / vec2(viewWidth, viewHeight)); // Samples the current pixel of the image with smooth linear filtering.
}
```
