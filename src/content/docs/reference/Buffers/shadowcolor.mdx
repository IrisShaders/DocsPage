### `uniform sampler2D shadowcolorN;`
### `layout (<format>) uniform image2D shadowcolorimgN;`

The shadow pass supplies two color attachments for outputing color/data, `shadowcolor0` and `shadowcolor1`. These samplers can be read from any program, and can be written to from the fragment stage of the [`shadow`](/reference/programs/shadow) and [`shadowcomp`](/reference/programs/shadow_comp) programs. 

#### Writing to ShadowColor buffers
Any [`shadow`](/reference/programs/shadow) or [`shadowcomp`](/reference/programs/shadow_comp) program can write to a shadowcolor buffer, the buffers to write to can be selected with the [`RENDERTARGETS`](/reference/constants/rendertargets) or [`DRAWBUFFERS`](/reference/constants/drawbuffers) directive.

Additionally, you can read and write to `shadowcolor0` and `shadowcolor1` using the image bindings `shadowcolorimg0` through `shadowcolorimg1` in any program. This is the only way to write to shadowcolor buffers from compute shaders. For more information on image load/store, see the [Khronos Wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Image_Load_Store).

#### Buffer size
These buffers default to the shadow pass resolution, which can be controlled with the `shadowMapResolution` constant.

#### Buffer format/precision
These buffers default `RGBA` format (which defaults to `RGBA8` on most systems), but this can be configured as described in the [Texture Formats](/reference/buffers/texture_format) section.

#### Buffer clear
By default these buffers clear their values after each frame to solid white (all 1s including alpha) This clearing behavior can be configured with the [`shadowcolorNClear`](/reference/constants/buffer_clear) directive, and the clear color can be configured with the [`shadowcolorNClearColor`](/reference/constants/buffer_clear_color) directive.

#### Ping-Pong buffers
Each colortex sampler actually contains two buffers, which allows you to read and write to the same buffer in a composite/deferred pass. The buffer flipping behavior can be controlled with the [`flip.<program>.<buffer>`](/reference/shadersproperties/buffer_flip) directive.

#### Legacy Alias
The sampler `shadowcolor0` is also accessible through the legacy `shadowcolor` alias.

#### Extended Shadowcolor
The [Feature Flag](/reference/shadersproperties/flags) `HIGHER_SHADOWCOLOR` enables additional shadowcolor buffers, `shadowcolor2` through `shadowcolor7`. These are identical to the other shadowcolor buffers outside of their name.
