### `uniform sampler2D noisetex;`

This buffer stores a generated RGB white noise texture. The resolution of this texture can be configured with the [`noiseTextureResolution`](/reference/constants/noisetextureresolution) constant, and defaults to 256x256. The texture is always square, meaning its width and height are equal.


## Custom Noise Texture
Similar to [Custom Textures](/reference/buffers/custom_textures), the `noisetex` texture can be overwritten with an image file from the shader files. The following line can be placed in [shaders.properties](/reference/shadersproperties/overview), where `<path>` is replaced with the file path of the image file relative to the "shaders" folder:

```properties title="shaders.properties"
texture.noise=<path>
```
