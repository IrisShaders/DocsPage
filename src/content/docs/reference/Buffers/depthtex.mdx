### `uniform sampler2D depthtexN;`

There are three samplers for accessing the depth buffer.
- `depthtex0` includes all geometry
- `depthtex1` excludes transparent geometry
- `depthtex2` excludes transparent and heldheld geometry

These buffers are written to by [`gbuffers`](/reference/programs/gbuffers) programs, and store the screenspace z coordinate at each pixel. These buffers only store information in a single channel, the red component. The depth buffer precision is hardware/driver dependent, however most hardware uses either 24-bit or 32-bit precision. The depth buffers are the same resolution as the Minecraft window and this cannot be changed.

### Legacy Alias
`depthtex0` can be accessed through the legacy alias `gdepthtex`.
