Constants are used to configure various aspects of the shader pack. Most constants only need to be included in at least one file to work, although usually only fragment shaders are scanned.

Additionally, this section includes the [`DRAWBUFFERS`](/reference/constants/drawbuffers) and [`RENDERTARGETS`](/reference/constants/rendertargets) comments, which are used to define which buffers each fragment shader writes to.
