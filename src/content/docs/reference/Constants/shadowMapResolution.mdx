### `const int shadowMapResolution = 1024;`

#### Location: any glsl file

Sets the resolution for [`shadowtex`](/reference/buffers/shadowtex) and [`shadowcolor`](/reference/buffers/shadowcolor) buffers used in the [shadow pass](/reference/programs/shadow). These buffers are always square, so the value applies to both x and y axes. The default value is 1024.
