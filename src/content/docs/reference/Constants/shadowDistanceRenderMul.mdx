### `const float shadowDistanceRenderMul = -1.0;`

#### Location: any glsl file

Sets the culling distance multiplier for the [shadow pass](/reference/programs/shadow).

By default this value is `-1`, which means geometry outside the [`shadowDistance`](/reference/constants/shadowdistance) are not culled. Setting this to a positive value applies culling to geometry outside `shadowDistance * shadowDistanceRenderMul` blocks from the camera. For example, `1.0` culls outside [`shadowDistance`](/reference/constants/shadowdistance), `0.5` culls outside half of [`shadowDistance`](/reference/constants/shadowdistance), and `2.0` culls outside twice [`shadowDistance`](/reference/constants/shadowdistance). `shadowDistanceRenderMul` has no effect on the scale of geometry in the [shadow pass](/reference/programs/shadow).
