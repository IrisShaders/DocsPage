### `const bool <bufferName>MipmapEnabled = true;`

#### Location: composite, deferred, final, prepare

This directive tells Iris to generate a mipmap chain for a [colortex](/reference/buffers/colortex) attachment. The mipmap chain will be generated directly before the program where the directive is included, if there are multiple programs it will be re-generated before each program containing the directive. This directive is only valid for [`begin`](/reference/programs/begin), [`prepare`](/reference/programs/prepare), [`deferred`](/reference/programs/deferred), or [`composite`](/reference/programs/composite) programs.

Replace `<bufferName>` with the name of a colortex sampler (e.g. `colortex2`).
