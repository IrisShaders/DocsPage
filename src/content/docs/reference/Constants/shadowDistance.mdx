### `const float shadowDistance = 160.0;`

#### Location: any glsl file

Sets the radius of the [shadow pass](/reference/programs/shadow) in blocks. The default value is 160 blocks.

By default this does not cull geometry outside that distance, only applying a scaling factor to the shadow projection matrix. However setting [`shadowDistanceRenderMul`](/reference/constants/shadowdistancerendermul) to a positive value will apply culling.
