<Aside type="danger">This attribute only works with the "core profile" in Minecraft `1.17` and newer. It is recommended to use the "compatibility profile" with Iris for better support. </Aside>

### `in vec2 vaUV0;`

**Valid Programs**: all gbuffers/shadow

The vertex texture coordinate attribute, equivalent to `gl_MultiTexCoord0` from the compatibility profile.

Usually the coordinate in `vaUV0` corresponds directly to the atlas texture coordinate, however some geometry (such as enchantment glint) requires the texture matrix. Therefore it is always recommended to use [`textureMatrix`](/reference/uniforms/matrices/texturematrix) (or `gl_TextureMatrix[0]` in the compatibility profile).
