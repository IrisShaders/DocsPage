### `in vec2 mc_midTexCoord;`

**Valid Programs**: all gbuffers/shadow

The texture UV coordinate of the center of the texture of the current quad.

> ***Note***: this is calculated per quad, so for example when rendering a slab block `mc_midTexCoord` points to the center of the portion of the texture covered by the slab, not the center of the parent block's texture.
