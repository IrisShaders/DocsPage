**Valid Programs**: terrain (*gbuffers_terrain*, *gbuffers_water*, *shadow*)

The `x` component stores the block ID which was assigned to the current block in [`block.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties). If an ID for the current block is not defined, a value of `-1` (newer Iris versions) or `0` (older Iris versions, Optifine) is sent.

> ***Note***: newer Iris versions use a signed short, meaning they can store IDs from `-32768` to `32767`. Older Iris versions and Optifine do not support negative values.

The `y` component stores the "render type", which is `1` for fluids (water, lava, etc) and `-1` for all other blocks.

This attribute is only available for terrain. For other types of geometry, see [`entityid`](/reference/uniforms/general/entityid) and [`blockentityid`](/reference/uniforms/general/blockentityid).
