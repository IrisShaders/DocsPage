### `in vec2 mc_Entity;`

**Valid Programs**: terrain (*gbuffers_terrain*, *gbuffers_water*, *shadow*)

The `x` component stores the block ID which was assigned to the current block in [`block.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties). If an ID for the current block is not defined, a value of `-1` is sent.

<Aside type="tip">Iris 1.3 and later (as well as Optifine) use a signed short for `mc_Entity`, meaning they can store IDs from `-32768` to `32767`. Older Iris versions do not support negative values, and will send `0` for any blocks with unassigned IDs.</Aside>

When [`block.properties`](/reference/miscellaneous/block_properties) is not present in the shader pack files, a legacy fallback is used. This assigns most block IDs according to their pre 1.13 numerical values, as described in the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_data_values/Pre-flattening#Block_IDs). This is intended for legacy purposes, and should not be used for new shader packs.

The `y` component stores the "render type", which is `1` for fluids (water, lava, etc) and `-1` for all other blocks.

This attribute is only available for terrain. For other types of geometry, see [`entityid`](/reference/uniforms/general/entityid) and [`blockentityid`](/reference/uniforms/general/blockentityid).
