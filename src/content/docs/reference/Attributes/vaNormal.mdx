<Aside type="danger">This attribute only works with the "core profile" in Minecraft `1.17` and newer. It is recommended to use the "compatibility profile" with Iris for better support. </Aside>

### `in vec3 vaNormal;`

**Valid Programs**: all gbuffers/shadow

The vertex normal vector attribute, equivalent to `gl_Normal.xyz` from the compatibility profile.

The normal vector from `vaNormal` is in model space (which varies for different geometry). It can be converted to view space using [`normalMatrix`](/reference/uniforms/matrices/normalmatrix) (or `gl_NormalMatrix` in the compatibility profile).
