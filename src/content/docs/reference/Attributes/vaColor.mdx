The vertex color attribute, equivalent to `gl_Color` from the compatibility profile.

The color attribute is often used to apply tints to colored blocks such as leaves, grass, water, etc. It also contains the [vanilla ao](/reference/constants/ambientocclusionlevel) and if enabled the [old lighting](/reference/shadersproperties/oldlighting). Enabling [`separateAo`](/reference/shadersproperties/separateao) will remove the vanilla ao from the rgb components of the color and put the ao in the alpha component.
