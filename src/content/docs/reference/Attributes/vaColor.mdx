<Aside type="danger">This attribute only works with the "core profile" in Minecraft `1.17` and newer. It is recommended to use the "compatibility profile" with Iris for better support. </Aside>

### `in vec4 vaColor;`

The vertex color attribute, equivalent to `gl_Color` from the compatibility profile.

The color attribute is often used to apply tints to colored blocks such as leaves, grass, water, etc. It also contains the [vanilla ao](/reference/constants/ambientocclusionlevel) and, if enabled, the [old lighting](/reference/shadersproperties/options#oldlighting).

Enabling [`separateAo`](/reference/shadersproperties/options#separateao) will move the AO from the `rgb` components of `vaColor` to the alpha component, which can be applied later like this:
```glsl
vec3 color = vaColor.rgb * vaColor.a;
```
