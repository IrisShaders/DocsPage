### `in vec4 at_midBlock;`

**Valid Programs**: terrain (*gbuffers_terrain*, *gbuffers_water*, *shadow*)

The first three components store the world/player space offset from the vertex's position to the center of the block in 1/64th block units. For example, the center position would be calculated like this:
```glsl
vec3 centerPosition = position + at_midBlock.xyz/64.0;
```

In Iris 1.7 and newer, `at_midBlock.w` stores the light level of the current block (without the influence of nearby light sources, range `0` to `15`). This can be used to tell if a block is emissive. It's recommended to use this together with [`BLOCK_EMISSION_ATTRIBUTE`](/reference/shadersproperties/flags).

This attribute (both the mid block offset and the emission value) are only available for terrain.
