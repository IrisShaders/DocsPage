### `const bool <bufferName>Clear = false;`

#### Location: any glsl shader file

This Clear directive allows a shader pack to disable clearing for a [colortex](/reference/buffers/colortex) or [shadowcolor](/reference/buffers/shadowcolor) color attachment. This means that the values written to the texture will be retained through the next frame instead of being cleared after every frame. The value the buffer is cleared to is controlled by the [`<bufferName>ClearColor`](/reference/directives/constants/buffer_clear_color) directive.

Replace `<bufferName>` with the name of a sampler (e.g. `colortex2` or `shadowcolor0`).

This directive only needs to be defined once in the shader pack, and can be defined in (mostly) any shader file.
