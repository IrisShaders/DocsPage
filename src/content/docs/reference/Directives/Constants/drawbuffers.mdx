### `/* DRAWBUFFERS:XYZ */`

#### Location: any fragment stage (.fsh) of any program

The legacy version of the [`RENDERTARGETS`](/reference/directives/constants/rendertargets) directive. This directive can only reference indicies 0 through 9, so `colortex10` through `colortex15` cannot be bound with this directive. Because of this, it is recommended to use [`RENDERTARGETS`](/reference/directives/constants/rendertargets) directive instead as that can access all available buffers.

To use this directive replace `XYZ` with the sequence of indices of color attachments. For example, putting `/* DRAWBUFFERS:0178 */` in `composite.fsh` would configure that program to write to `colortex0`, `colortex1`, `colortex7`, and `colortex8`. The comment can be placed anywhere in the `.fsh` file.

More information on how this buffer applies to outputing values is in the [`RENDERTARGETS`](/reference/directives/constants/rendertargets) section.
