### `voxelizeLightBlocks=<true|false>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

Using `voxelizeLightBlocks` in shaders.properties, you can now voxelize light blocks in the shadow or main pass.

This only applies to light blocks ([Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Light_Block)), which are a specific block which is invisible but emits a specific level of light. This does not affect any other blocks or geometry.

Light blocks will be rendered as a single (degenerate) invisible quad with all points centered on the middle of the block. (`at_midBlock` will be 0.) The ID will correspond as normal to the light block, and UV will be 0. `lmcoord.xy` will both be the value of the light made by the light block.
