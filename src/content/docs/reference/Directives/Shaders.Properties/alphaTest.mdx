### `alphaTest.<program>=<off|func ref>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

This directive is used to control the alpha test for cutout programs. For the compatibility profile the alpha test is applied automatically when using `gl_FragData` or `gl_FragColor`. For the newer syntax, only the reference value is passed through [`alphaTestRef`](/reference/uniforms/general/alphatestref) and the function must be implemented by the shader.

- Replace `<program>` with a gbuffers program name, including the dimension folder if relevant (e.g. `world0/composite2`). This does not work with Iris custom dimensions however.
- Replace `<off|func ref>` with `off` to disable alpha testing, or replace `func` with one of the following functions: `NEVER`, `LESS`, `EQUAL`, `LEQUAL`, `GREATER`, `NOTEQUAL`, `GEQUAL`, `GL_ALWAYS`. Replace `<ref>` with a reference value. The alpha value of the primary output will then be compared to this reference value using the function defined in `func`, and if it does not pass the value will be discarded (not written to the output buffer).
