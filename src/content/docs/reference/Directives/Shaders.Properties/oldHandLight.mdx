### `oldHandLight=<true|false>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

Sets a fallback for older shaders which don't support main and alt hands. If `oldHandLight` is set to `true`, [`heldBlockLightValue`](/reference/uniforms/general/heldblocklightvalue) will take the value of the highest light value. The default value is `true` for legacy packs, so it must be specifically disabled to have independent main and alt hand light values.
