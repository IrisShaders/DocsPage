### `shadow.culling=<true|false|reversed>`

#### Location: shaders.properties

Controls culling in the [`shadow`](/reference/programs/shadow) pass. Enabling it will prevent geometry which would not cast a shadow through the view frustum from rendering. Disabling it will prevent any geometry within the shadow distance from being culled.

Iris adds an additional option, `reversed`, which disables culling within a specific radius of the player as defined in [`voxelDistance`](/reference/directives/constants/voxeldistance), while retaining culling outside of that distance. It is also recommended (but not required) to use the feature flag [`REVERSED_CULLING`](/reference/directives/shadersproperties/flags) to avoid compatibility issues with older Iris versions.
