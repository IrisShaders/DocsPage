Feature flags are an Iris system to query the activation state of certain features. To activate them there are two directives that can be placed in `shader.properties`: `iris.features.required` and `iris.features.optional`. `iris.features.required` will throw an error if your device or version of Iris does not support the feature. `iris.features.optional` will create a define that can be used to test the availability of such a feature. Additionally the `IS_IRIS` define can be used to test if your shader is in Iris or optifine, and always exists.

To use the flags add the following to your `shaders.properties`:
```properties
iris.features.required=SEPARATE_HARDWARE_SAMPLERS COMPUTE_SHADERS
iris.features.optional=BLOCK_EMISSION_ATTRIBUTE ENTITY_TRANSLUCENT SSBO
```

The following are currently valid options:

`SEPARATE_HARDWARE_SAMPLERS` (required for Separate Hardware Shadow Samplers)

`PER_BUFFER_BLENDING`

`COMPUTE_SHADERS`

`ENTITY_TRANSLUCENT` (recommended, but not required for Entity Translucent)

`SSBO` (required for Shader Storage Buffer Objects)

`CUSTOM_IMAGES` (required for Custom Images)

`HIGHER_SHADOWCOLOR` (required for Extended Shadowcolor)

`REVERSED_CULLING` (recommended, but not required for Reverse Shadow Culling)

`BLOCK_EMISSION_ATTRIBUTE` (recommended, but not required for [Block Emission: at_midBlock.w] as of [iris-1.7.0-snapshotmc1.20.4-a787322])
