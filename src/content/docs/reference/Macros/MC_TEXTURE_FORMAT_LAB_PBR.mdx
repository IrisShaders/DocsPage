Based on the current Resource Pack's texture format (defined in texture.properties), one or more of the following macros may be defined:

- `MC_TEXTURE_FORMAT_LAB_PBR`
- `MC_TEXTURE_FORMAT_LAB_PBR_1_3`

`MC_TEXTURE_FORMAT_LAB_PBR` will be defined if any version of the [labPBR standard](https://shaderlabs.org/wiki/LabPBR_Material_Standard) is declared by the Resource Packs. `MC_TEXTURE_FORMAT_LAB_PBR_1_3` will only be defined if labPBR 1.3 is declared.
