-------------------------------------------------

A composite pass which runs after (most) opaque [gbuffers](/reference/programs/gbuffers) programs but before (most) translucent [gbuffers](/reference/programs/gbuffers) programs. Like other composite programs, it renders a single fullscreen quad over the resolution of the buffer(s) it writes to.
