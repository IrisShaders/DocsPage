## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a vulnerability, we would like to know so we can fix it before it is released publicly. Do not open a GitHub issue for a found vulnerability.

Please join [The Iris Discord](https://discord.gg/jQJnav2jPu) and dm one of the docs developers. Send the details:

- where the vulnerability can be observed
- a brief description of the vulnerability
- optionally the type of vulnerability
- non-destructive exploitation details
- We will do our best to reply as fast as possible.
